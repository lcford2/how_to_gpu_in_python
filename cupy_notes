A couple observations on cupy having tried some examples this morning:

1.  Not all of numpy is covered, see: https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/comparison.html , 
  not much sparse-matrix compared to numpy for example
2.  It’s not quite as simple as : sed -e s/numpy/cupy/g   , 
  in particular you still have to manage data movement if you need to work with arrays in the host environment 
  (plotting, printing results, post-processing )
3.  A good cupy program is going to have a layout and flow a lot like a good CUDA program (like it or leave it ).  
  The data movement should be minimized and happen together in bunches.  
  cupy routines should be numerous and operate on large arrays (think millions not thousands of elements).  
  There needs to be enough cupy work on the gpu to make it all “worth it”.
